Driver |driver|
=========================

Driver action creates ranged connection between attributes and creates the missing attributes. Useful to control rig values with custom attributes and adding extra features which is not defined by kinematics.

The result is very similar to what you would get with set driven keys but instead of using keyframes this uses ranged mapped connections. Mapping row creates new mappings, changes their order, removes or duplicates them and clears the whole table. Once the 'New' button pressed, a new row appears in the table.
